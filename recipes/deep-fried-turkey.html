    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking oil</li>
      <li>10 pound turkey</li>
      <li>Seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure your stockpot or fryer is located outdoors in a safe area. Heat the oil to 350 degrees F. Cut any
        neck
        skin away from the thawed bird and make sure the neck hole is at least 1-inch in diameter.</li>
      <li>Use a paper towel to pat the turkey dry. Season liberally with salt and pepper on the inside and outside.</li>
      <li>Place the turkey, neck-side down, in a drain basket. Gently lower the turkey into the hot oil until it's
        completely covered. Continue frying until the turkey is cooked through. Remove from the oil, drain, and allow to
        rest for 15 minutes before carving.</li>
