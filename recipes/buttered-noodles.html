    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or
      meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish,
      although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe,
      yet
      I get many questions on how to make it.
